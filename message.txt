Hey {first}! We are so close to reaching our goal of volunteers for the first day assigned to us, April 25th, and we just need to fill a few more spots. 

If you are willing to serve more than one shift, PLEASE let me know over text and we would be happy to make that work.

The YSA Temple Open House Committee and I also ask for your help to fill those spots by getting one more friend to volunteer and fill out this form:

I know your efforts will be blessed, and that the Lord is pleased with your willingness to serve!

Thank you for signing up to help out ðŸ˜Š!
